#Walkers
_By [M4Numbers](https://github.com/M4Numbers/)_

##What is Walkers?

Walkers is going to be a library, written in Python, which allows a user to interact with
one of several social services. When it is complete, it will allow a user to, at the very
least, view their inputs on their chosen social service.

##What Services Will There Be?

So far, I am planning for a few central social services that are relatively easy to implement
and a few which are less so. So far, these include in no particular order:

 * Facebook
 * YouTube
 * Reddit
 * Imgur
 * Twitter

##Note

__This is still a work in progress.__ Several items may, and probably will, change during
development (however long that lasts anyway). Since I'm reasonably new to Python, a few 
good practices may have slipped me by during the early stages that I subsequently need to
go and solve.

##Why Walkers?

No particular reason; maybe the observation that these APIs are basically zombies in that
they mindlessly respond and act on what happens (a.k.a. Walkers)... Which actually works
quite well considering that I'm naming each of these things 'crawlers' (being the walkers
which are more passive than most)... Don't I have a nice collection of zombies :)
